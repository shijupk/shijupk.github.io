## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with over 17 years of experience in **Senior Architect, Technical Lead, and Lead Developer roles**, with a specialized focus on **distributed systems**, **cloud-native development**, and **microservice architecture**. My expertise includes the end-to-end design and development of **scalable, multi-threaded software systems** across **on-premise** and **cloud platforms**. I have successfully led architecture transitions for large-scale systems, optimizing performance, security, and resilience.

### Cloud Development & Distributed Systems

In recent years, I have worked extensively on **cloud-native migration** projects, transforming legacy on-premise systems into highly distributed, scalable solutions that leverage modern cloud infrastructure. I have hands-on experience with **AWS services** such as **EBS, S3, RDS, ECS, Amazon MQ, ALB, NLB, and Route53**, where I‚Äôve optimized cloud performance, reduced operational costs, and enhanced system scalability. My cloud development work involves designing high-performance **object storage** systems (S3), ensuring that cloud-based storage can match or exceed the performance of traditional on-premise storage like SAN.

I have a deep understanding of **distributed systems**, where I focus on ensuring **high availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **horizontal scalability**. I‚Äôve architected messaging infrastructures that efficiently handle high-bandwidth data transmission and streaming, ensuring seamless communication between services in a distributed environment.

### Microservice Architecture

As a strong advocate of **microservice architecture**, I‚Äôve been instrumental in transitioning monolithic systems to **microservices**, significantly improving **scalability**, **performance**, and **maintainability**. I‚Äôve designed and implemented robust microservice frameworks that feature key elements like **Authentication & Authorization (OAuth, HMAC)**, **DoS prevention**, and **API security**. I‚Äôve also integrated **Single Sign-On (SSO)** using **OpenID Connect**, enabling secure, centralized access across distributed applications.

My work in this space includes building **horizontally scalable, highly available microservices** for critical systems such as **Philips Picture Archival and Communication System (PACS)**. These services have been designed to handle massive data loads and ensure fast, efficient retrieval and processing of medical images in hospital environments.

### Technical Expertise

With deep expertise in **C++11/17**, **C# (.NET 8.0)**, and **Python**, I write efficient, high-performance code for distributed, real-time applications. My strengths include:

- **Architecture & Design Patterns**: Microservices, Pub-Sub, Active-Object, Strategy, MVVM, and more.
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EBS, S3, RDS, ECS, Amazon MQ, ALB, NLB, Route53).
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimizing algorithms and software performance using instruction sets such as **AVX** and **SSE3**.
- **Image Processing & Machine Learning**: Developing advanced algorithms for medical imaging, including **mammography tomography workflows**, and high-bandwidth streaming solutions.
- **Security & Resilience**: Implementing security frameworks for microservices, focusing on **OAuth**, **HMAC**, **DoS prevention**, and secure API gateways.

### My Approach

I am passionate about **deep problem analysis** and strive to deliver solutions that solve challenges in the **first attempt**. I‚Äôve introduced methodologies like **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Performance-First** development, ensuring the systems I build are not only robust but also maintainable and high-performing.

As a technical leader, I work closely with teams, conducting regular **design and code reviews**, and guiding the architectural direction to ensure high-quality software delivery. I thrive in environments where I can contribute as an architect or lead developer, solving complex challenges in cloud and distributed systems, while continuing to push the boundaries of software development.

I‚Äôm always looking for opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills in **cloud development**, **distributed systems**, and **microservice architecture**, while continually enhancing my craft through challenging and innovative projects.
